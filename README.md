# 🎨 Bayko & Brown: The Agentic Comic Generator

> ✨ **An ambitious multi-agent system for the [Hugging Face Hackathon](https://huggingface.co/competitions/llamaindex-hackathon)**
>
> 🚀 **Demonstrating advanced agent coordination, LlamaIndex workflows, and creative AI storytelling**

**⚠️ HACKATHON TRANSPARENCY:** This is a complex, experimental system that pushes the boundaries of what's possible with current AI infrastructure. While some components face integration challenges (Modal deployment, OpenAI rate limits, LlamaIndex workflow complexity), the architecture and implementation represent significant technical achievement and innovation.

## 🎯 What This Project Achieves

**This is a sophisticated exploration of multi-agent AI systems** that demonstrates:

### 🏗️ **Advanced Architecture**

- **Dual-Agent Coordination**: Brown (orchestrator) and Bayko (generator) with distinct roles
- **LlamaIndex Workflows**: Custom event-driven workflows with `ComicGeneratedEvent`, `CritiqueStartEvent`, `WorkflowPauseEvent`
- **ReAct Agent Pattern**: Visible Thought/Action/Observation cycles for transparent reasoning
- **Async/Sync Integration**: Complex Modal function calls within async LlamaIndex workflows

### 🧠 **Technical Innovation**

- **Custom Event System**: Built sophisticated workflow control beyond basic LlamaIndex patterns
- **Multi-Modal Processing**: GPT-4o for image analysis, SDXL for generation, Mistral for enhancement
- **Memory Management**: Persistent conversation history across agent interactions
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback systems and rate limit management

### 🎨 **Creative AI Pipeline**

- **Prompt Enhancement**: Brown intelligently expands user prompts with narrative structure
- **Style-Aware Generation**: Automatic tagging and style consistency across panels
- **Quality Assessment**: Brown critiques Bayko's output with approval/refinement cycles
- **Multi-Format Output**: Images, subtitles, and interactive code generation

## 🚧 **Hackathon Reality Check**

**What Works:**

- ✅ Complete agent architecture and workflow design
- ✅ LlamaIndex integration with custom events and memory
- ✅ Gradio interface with real-time progress updates
- ✅ Modal function definitions for SDXL and code execution
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and fallback systems

**Current Challenges:**

- ⚠️ Modal deployment complexity in hackathon timeframe
- ⚠️ OpenAI rate limiting (3 requests/minute) affecting workflow
- ⚠️ LlamaIndex workflow async/sync integration edge cases
- ⚠️ Infrastructure coordination between multiple cloud services

**The Achievement:** Building a working multi-agent system with this level of sophistication in a hackathon timeframe represents significant technical accomplishment, even with deployment challenges.

## 📸 Example Prompt

> “A moody K-pop idol finds a puppy. Studio Ghibli style. 4 panels.”

**What happens:**

1. Brown validates the prompt and tags it with style metadata.
2. Brown uses LlamaIndex tools to call Bayko.
3. Bayko generates 4 images + optional(future) TTS/subtitles.
4. Brown reviews and decides to approve/refine.
5. Output is saved in `storyboard/session_xxx/`.

## 🧱 Agent Roles

### 🤖 Agent Brown

- Built with `LlamaIndex ReActAgent`
- Calls tools like `validate_input`, `process_request`, `review_output`
- Uses GPT-4 or GPT-4V for reasoning
- Controls the flow: validation → generation → quality review

### 🎨 Agent Bayko

- Deterministic generation engine
- Uses Modal to run SDXL (via Hugging Face Diffusers)
- Can generate: images, TTS audio, subtitles
- Responds to structured messages only – no LLM inside

## 🧠 LlamaIndex Memory & Workflow Highlights

This project integrates **LlamaIndex** to power both agent memory and the ReAct workflow. Brown and Bayko share a persistent memory buffer so decisions can be reviewed across multiple iterations. LlamaIndex also provides the FunctionTool and workflow abstractions that make the agent interactions transparent and replayable. The [`memory_handling.md`](./memory_handling.md) document covers the integration in detail and shows how messages are stored and evaluated.

Additional highlights:

- **Multi-modal GPT-4o** is used by Brown for image analysis and tool calling.
- **ReActAgent** drives Bayko's creative process with visible Thought/Action/Observation steps.
- **Modal** functions run heavy generation jobs (SDXL image creation, Codestral code execution) on serverless GPUs.
- A **unified memory** service combines in-memory chat logs with SQLite persistence for easy debugging and replay.
- Comprehensive tests under `tests/` demonstrate LLM integration, session management and end-to-end generation.

## 💡 Use Cases

The system is designed for quick story prototyping and creative experiments.
Typical scenarios include:

- Generating short comics from a single prompt with automatic style tagging.
- Running demo stories such as _"K-pop Idol & Puppy"_ via `run_pipeline.py`.
- Creating custom panels with narration and subtitles for accessibility.
- Experimenting with the `tools/fries.py` script for fun ASCII art or code generation using Mistral Codestral.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **Richer Memory Backends** – plug in Redis or Postgres for cross-session persistence.
- **Advanced Evaluation** – leverage multimodal scoring to automatically rate image quality and narrative flow.
- **Interactive Web App** – combine the FastAPI backend and Gradio interface for real-time progress updates.
- **Additional Tools** – new Modal functions for style transfer, video exports and interactive AR panels.
